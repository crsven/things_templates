# Things Templates

An easy(?) way to save templates for Things.app. These can include projects or
items that you often find yourself creating over and over together.
Example: a template might include the ingredients needed for a particular
recipe that you want to add to a grocery list.

## Installation

`$ gem install things_templates`

## Usage

`$ build_template <path to template>`
